# Dev Container CLI

This repository holds the dev container CLI, which can take a devcontainer.json and create and configure a dev container from it.

## Context

A development container allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud.

This CLI is in active development. Current status:

- [x] `dev-containers-cli build` - Enables building/pre-building images
- [x] `dev-containers-cli up` - Spins up containers with `devcontainer.json` settings applied
- [x] `dev-containers-cli run-user-commands` - Runs lifecycle commands like `postCreateCommand`
- [x] `dev-containers-cli read-configuration` - Outputs current configuration for workspace
- [x] `dev-containers-cli exec` - Executes a command in a container with `userEnvProbe`, `remoteUser`, `remoteEnv`, and other properties applied
- [ ] `dev-containers-cli stop` - Stops containers
- [ ] `dev-containers-cli down` - Stops and deletes containers

## Specification

The dev container CLI is part of the [Development Containers Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/dev-container-spec). This spec seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option â€“ so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing.

Learn more on the [dev container spec website](https://devcontainers.github.io/containers.dev/).
